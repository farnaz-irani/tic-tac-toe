# Coding Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe

Today we're going to test and improve our coding skills by creating a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. 

## Task 1

Fork this repository, clone it on your machine and create a new environment.  
Don't forget to activate it for the assignment. 

```bash:shell
 conda create --name tictactoe python=3.8.5
 conda install -n tictactoe pip
 ```

## Task 2

Write your own Tic-Tac-Toe game. The assignment file contains a description on how the game should work. It may also help you to create a good structure for your code. 

Before you start, have a look at the file [Intro_to_pseudocode.md](Intro_to_pseudocode.md). The technique described there could be useful for this task.
