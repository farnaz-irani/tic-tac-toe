# Coding Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe

Today we're going to test and improve our coding skills by creating a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. 

## Task 1
Fork and clone that repo to your local machine.  
Before you start, have a look at the file [Intro_to_pseudocode.md](Intro_to_pseudocode.md). The technique described there could be useful for this task. 
Start the challenge by writing Pseudocode!

## Task 2

Create a new virtual environment called *tictactoe*.  

```bash:shell
 conda create --name tictactoe python=3.8.5
 ```

## Task 3

Write your own Tic-Tac-Toe game. The assignment file contains a description on how the game should work. It may also help you to create a good structure for your code.
